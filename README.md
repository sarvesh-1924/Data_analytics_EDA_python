Heatmap for correlation analysis

💡 Key Insights

Electronics is the highest revenue and profit-generating category.

Corporate customers contribute higher profit per order.

Discounts negatively impact profitability.

Sales show steady growth with seasonal trends.

Revenue is concentrated in a few high-value products.

Business risk is reduced due to regional diversification.

Some high-sales orders result in losses due to heavy discounts.

Pricing and discount optimization can significantly improve profit.

🎯 Conclusion

The analysis highlights that while sales performance is strong, profitability is highly sensitive to discounts and product mix.
Focusing on high-margin products and profitable customer segments can drive sustainable business growth.
